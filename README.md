Architecting modular AI systems with structured memory, intent routing, and execution engines.

---

## Current Focus

- Agent-based AI architecture
- Structured memory systems (explicit / implicit separation)
- Intent-driven routing (no hard-coded heuristics)
- Trading structural analysis engines
- Long-horizon analytical modeling

---

## Architecture Principles

- Modular layered design (UI → Hooks → Services → Contracts)
- No monolithic files
- Write-after-response memory
- Zero execution authority for memory
- Explicit separation of analysis vs strategy
- Deterministic execution boundaries

---

## Selected Systems

- AI Agent (memory-first architecture)
- AI Trading Assistant (structural engine integration)
- Long-horizon market analysis framework
